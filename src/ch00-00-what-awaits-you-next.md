Your journey in the world of Cairo is far from over, and there are several exciting paths you can take based on your interests and goals. Here's a glimpse of what awaits you next:

### Cairo and Trusted Computing

Cairo allows you to compute trustworthy values on untrusted machines. One major use case is Starknet, a solution to Ethereum scaling. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of decentralized applications where every single interaction between a user and a d-app is verified by all the participants. Starknet is a Layer 2 built on top of Ethereum. Instead of having all the participants of the network verify all user interactions, only one node, called the prover, executes the programs and generates proofs that the computations were done correctly. These proofs are then verified by an Ethereum smart contract, requiring significantly less computational power compared to executing the interactions themselves. This approach allows for increased throughput and reduced transaction costs while preserving Ethereum security.

### Communities to Help You

As you embark on your journey into the world of Cairo and Starknet, it's valuable to be part of communities where you can seek answers to questions, share your knowledge, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Here are some communities to consider:
