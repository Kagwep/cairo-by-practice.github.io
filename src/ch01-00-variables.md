# Variables


We are assuming you have gone through the cairo book

### Variables and Mutability 

* Cairo uses an **immutable memory model**, meaning you can't change data once it's written.
* Variables in Cairo are **immutable by default**.

1. 

```rust,editable

    use debug::PrintTrait;
    
    // Fix the error below 

    fn main() {
        
        let x = 5;

        print(x);
        
    }


```

2. 

```rust,editable

    use debug::PrintTrait;

    // Fix the error below 

    fn main() {
        // variable x is immutable
        let x = 5,

        x.print();
    }

```

* Cairo allows you to make variables **mutable when needed**.
* You can make variables mutable by adding `"mut"` in front of the variable name.

1. 

```rust,editable
// Fill the blanks in the code to make it compile

    use debug::PrintTrait;
fn main() {
    
    let __ __ = 5;
    x.print();

    x += 6;
    x.print();
}


```

2. 

```rust,editable

// Fix the error with the use of mut and defining y

    use debug::PrintTrait;

    fn main() {
        
        let x = 5;
        x.print();

        x = y;

        x.print();
    }
```



* Variable mutability is implemented as **syntactic sugar**.


# Constants

Constants are like variables, but they never change. They are always immutable.

ðŸ‘‰ Constants cannot use "mut," and they are always immutable. You declare them with "const" and must annotate the type.

1. 

```rust,editable

// fix the line of code below

const ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS = 3600;

```

Constants can only be declared in the global scope, making them suitable for values needed throughout the code.


2. 

```rust,editable

    // Introduce a const  ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS

        use debug::PrintTrait;    

        fn main() {

            let one_hour_in_seconds_plus_one = one_hour_in_seconds_plus_one(ONE_HOUR_IN_SECONDS);

            one_hour_in_seconds_plus_one.print();
        }

        fn one_hour_in_seconds_plus_one(one_hour_in_seconds: u32) -> u32 {
            one_hour_in_seconds + 1
        }

```

Constants can only be set to constant expressions, not values calculated at runtime. Only literal constants are supported.

1. 

```rust,editable

// examples- fill in the blanks
const MAX_VALUE: u32 = 100;
const SECONDS_PER_MINUTE: u32 = __;
const MINUTES_PER_HOUR: u32 = __;

```

Cairo uses uppercase letters with underscores to name constants.

> Constants are valid throughout the program's runtime, making them suitable for values like maximum points in a game or fundamental constants.



# Scope

A scope is the range within the program for which the variable is valid.

1. 

-

```rust,editable
use debug::PrintTrait;
    // fix the error
    fn main() {
        let x = 5; // Outer scope
        
        {
            let x = x * 2; // Inner scope
            let y = 7;
            'Inner scope x value is:'.print();
            x.print(); 
            

        }
        'Outer scope x value is:'.print();
        x.print(); 
        y.print();
    }

```

2. 


```rust,editable

    use debug::PrintTrait;

// Fix the error with the use of define_greetings

    fn main() {
 
        x.print(); 
    }

    fn define_greetings() {
        let x = "hello World";
    }

```


## Shadowing

Variable shadowing is the practice of declaring a new variable with the same name as an existing one, effectively taking precedence in scope.


1. 

```rust,editable
use debug::PrintTrait;
// Only modify  the code below to make it work

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 2;
    {
        let x = 10;

        assert(x, 12,'Expected 12');
    }

    assert(x, 2);

    let x = 20;
    x.print();
}


```

2. 

```rust,editable
use debug::PrintTrait;

// modify  the code so that x is 16

fn main() {
    let x = 5; 

    let x = x + 1; 


    {
        let x = x * 2; 

        assert(x == 16, 'Expected 16');

        'Inner scope x value is:'.print();
        x.print(); 

    }

    'Outer scope x value is:'.print();
    x.print(); 
}


```

>Shadowing allows reassignment of variables while maintaining immutability, unlike using `mut`.

1. 

```rust,editable
        // fix the error by using let x = five();

        use debug::PrintTrait;

        fn five() -> u32 {
            5
        }

        fn main() {
            
            x.print();
        }

```

- Shadowing permits changing the variable type within the same name, which is not possible with `mut`.

Shadowing can help keep code cleaner and more flexible when dealing with variables.
